	<p>I am tired of the conversation about form “versus” content, and how it always has to involve a hierarchy. As designers, why do we have to assign more value to one over the other? Why can’t form exist on the same plane as content, rather than on an inferior one (as Beatrice Warde argues), or on a more meaningful one, as Michael Rock calls for in “Fuck Content”? I believe it is more useful to acknowledge design as a medium that creates an expressive fusion between the two. Form augments content; but in turn, content is just as important to inform good, thoughtful design. I think that both form and content can be thought of to play an active, symbiotic role in creating a well-designed “thing,” and I think the interplay between them makes the most interesting work.

	It doesn’t matter which came first. If you have a glass of wine, you can also have a beautiful empty glass, and you can also have a puddle of wine on the floor. They are both things that exist separately. But together, they elevate each other to become something greater than their sum, and the mutually beneficial relationship between them is what makes a good “glass of wine.” Similarly, you can have a really nice typeface, and a really nice story; but setting the story in the right typeface adds nuance and texture to the storytelling and gives the typeface a moment to shine, too. Just because the merits of using a beautiful typeface include an aesthetic benefit (among other benefits!) doesn’t mean typefaces are shallow and vain—that seems like an antiquated point. If you are still making it, you don’t fully understand the mystical and sensuous language that designers speak.
