    <p class="question"><i>“Art appears when what is made feels as if there is a profound misunderstanding at the heart of what it is, as if it were made with the wrong use in mind, or the wrong idea about what it is capable of, or simply the wrong set of assumptions about what it means to fully function in the world. A work works by not working at all. By not obeying the law of any system or authority external to the process of its own making, a work emphatically expresses its own right to exist for itself and in itself, and questions — by merely existing — the rule of law that works to bind all to semblance of the common good. Art is a lawless proposition.” Do you agree with Chan’s definition of art? Do you think this can be extended to design as well? </i></p>

    <p>I agree with Paul Chan here, and it is interesting to think about how his argument relates to design regarding what Dan Michaelson says about art.yale.edu. As Chan says, most artists make art and not the other way around. The artwork is a means to one intended end, and “work like this can be experienced in a flash, because the form is merely a mannequin for what that “something is…,” i.e. the “art of advertising.” I think similarly, most design falls into this category, especially because most design in the world lives in a commercial sphere. However, Chan’s definition of art as a “lawless proposition” creating its own rules of governance, when the art happens by “making the artist” instead of the reverse, has the most exciting implications for design. The Yale School of Art website, as a participatory network designed with its own set of rules, and which has trouble existing in an external system of real laws, has these artful qualities. As a malleable network that has the ability to surprise itself, the website fits Cézanne’s ideal of earthly joy as “a beautiful formula.” In this model, when the designer agrees to relinquish some of the control to the user, an exchange can begin between the designer and the user that creates possibility instead of stagnancy.

    Chan’s definition of narrow-minded art is like Ovid’s myth of Pygmalion, who sculpts a beautiful woman out of ivory and falls in love with her. He wishes that she would become real, and Aphrodite grants his wish—so she comes to life, exactly as he wants her to, and they get married. The myth ends there. Pygmalion creates his own ideal of beauty, which is a singular creation that exists to serve his needs. I think that this is what most art has been like for centuries. Maybe a more useful metaphor for Chan’s definition of art is birth, when one body (the artist or designer) creates something organic that lives with its own autonomy. The YSoA website does this, and is able to because of the relationships and exchanges it has with every member of the school’s student body, faculty, and staff. It operates according to its own ecosystem of laws, which result from a complicated interplay of existing ones.
